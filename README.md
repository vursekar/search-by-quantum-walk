# search-by-quantum-walk
Fortran code to simulate a discrete-time quantum walk on 1D/2D lattices. 
Alterable parameters include: size of the lattice, time steps in walk, 
coin operator, types and scale of unitary errors. It can also be used
to simulate a quantum walk search algorithm to find a marked site. For
walks that include random elements, such as noise, multiple walks can
be run to obtain averages.
